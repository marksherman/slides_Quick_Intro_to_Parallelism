## How to Build
Uses [marp](https://marp.app). Highly recommend using the marp plugin for Visual Studio Code. It can do everything you need without installing anything else, including exporting. I also used the marp command line program to make the html and pdf outputs, which you see here. It would be the same as if you exported those from the VS Code plugin!

### HTML Generation
```bash
marp PITCHME.md -o index.html
```

### PDF Generation

```bash
marp --pdf --allow-local-files PITCHME.md -o QuickIntroToParallelism.pdf
```
